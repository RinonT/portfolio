                    I am Rinon. I come from a small town called Vodiriana in Moramanga's district, but I am currently living in Mahanoro, which is a town on the east cost of Madagascar, where <a href="https://onja.org/">Onja</a> is located.
                    I grew up in a hard working familly that earns their living from agriculture and selling the products in the market.
                    I finished high school in 2016 at the age of 18. Then started wondering what to do next.

                    I had an ambition to go on to study at the university but I couldn't because I had a financial problem.
                    As most people in my hometown do, I was working as a farmer dispite the knowledge and kills that I have gained from school. It is not easy to ear your living from agriculture. Imagine bearing the hot weather or rain the whole day.
                    I enjoyed it though but I had to leave my village in 2017 in order to look for a different life by working in a small company in the city but it could not really help me and my familly because I have to help my younger siblings as well with their studies.

                    While wondering what to do next after quiting this job, I received a letter from <a href="https://onja.org/">Onja</a> to take the first test to be part of the students who are going to study english for two years and programming for a year.
                    I passed it and went on to the next steps. Then I met all of the requirements that <a href="https://onja.org/">Onja</a> set. Now, I have been studying english for two years and programming for over a year.I never spoke english or used a computer before coming to <a href="https://onja.org/">Onja</a> but now, I can have smooth conversations with any english native speaker and I can build a lot of web projects with the technoliogies that I have learned. My life has been ectic but enjoyable as well. We have to work hard in order to get into the level that is aimed.
